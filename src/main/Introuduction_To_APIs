A server is a powerful computer that runs an API
API is the hidden information behind an app that is meant for computer consumption
A client exchanges data between a server and a API
Communication in HTTP centers around a concept called the RequestResponse Cycle
To make a valid request, the client needs to include four things URI, a method, List of headers, and a body

The four methods most commonly seen in APIs are:
• GET - Asks the server to retrieve a resource
• POST - Asks the server to create a new resource
• PUT - Asks the server to edit/update an existing resource
• DELETE - Asks the server to delete a resource

 Request - consists of a URL (http://…), a method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), a list of headers (User-Agent…), and a body (data).
Response - consists of a status code (200, 404…), a list of headers, and a body.
Many new APIs have adopted JSON as a format because it's built on the popular Javascript programming language,
JSON could be used for front end or back end
Objects could used be a value for keys
JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
Object: a thing or noun (person, pizza order...)
Key: an attribute about an object (color, toppings...)
Value: the value of an attribute (blue, pepperoni...)
Associative array: a nested object
 XML: Extensible Markup Language
Authentication: process of the client proving its identity to the server
Credentials: secret pieces of info used to prove the client's identity (username, password...)
Basic Auth: scheme that uses an encoded username and password for credentials
API Key Auth: scheme that uses a unique key for credentials
Authorization Header: the HTTP header used to hold credentials
OAuth: an authentication scheme that automates the key exchange between client and server.
Access Token: a secret that the client obtains upon successfully completing the OAuth process.
Scope: permissions that determine what access the client has to user's data
SOAP: API architecture known for standardized message formats
REST: API architecture that centers around manipulating resources
Resource: API term for a business noun like customer or order
Endpoint: A URL that makes up part of an API. In REST, each resource gets its own endpoints
Query String: A portion of the URL that is used to pass data to the server
Query Parameters: A key-value pair found in the query string (topping=cheese)
Pagination: Process of splitting up results into manageable chunks
